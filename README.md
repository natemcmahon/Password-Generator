# Password Generator

Webpage which generates a password based on user specified criteria

## Description

The Password Generator is a webpage which showcases basic HTML and CSS coupled with JavaScript. Upon landing on the webpage we are hit with Windows alerts, prompts and confirms in order to gain more information about what the user wants the password to look like including which character sets it should contain and length. It error proofs to make sure the user selects at least one character set. It then utilizes Javascript functions to generate the password and write it to an HTML element using query selectors. It finally utilizes event listeners to generate the password in our UI. If the user is unhappy with the generated password, they are able to re click the button as many times as they'd like and the UI will be refreshed with a new password.
